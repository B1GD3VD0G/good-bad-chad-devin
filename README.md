The Good, the Bad, and Chad!  
A web game by Devin Peevy, Trae Claar, Nathan Hinthorne, and Caleb Krauter.  
Made for TCSS 491 at UW Tacoma, Winter 2024.  

The Good, the Bad, and Chad! is a single-player, story-driven two-dimensional platformer made in JavaScript. It [will be] runnable at https://github.io/GoodBadChad/good-bad-chad-br.  

You are Chad - ripped, courageous, charming, and very full of yourself. Your whole life changes when you are asked to investigate some weird noises in a cave, and are thrust into an interdimensional adventure to stop an evil wizard with nothing but a slingshot and your trusty wooden sword! You must save the multiverse in order to save your peaceful village. Are you up for the task? And if you are, will you still be the same when you return?
